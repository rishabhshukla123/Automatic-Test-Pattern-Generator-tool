Welcome

In this note we have described about our work.

Folder: approximate_adder-
In this folder there are 4 files. 
a)Verilog file for approximate adder circuit
b)Test patterns for approximate adder circuit
other two files are used for generating test pattrens.

Folder: approximate_multiplier
In this folder there are 4 files. 
a)Verilog file for approximate multiplier circuit
b)Test patterns for approximate multiplier circuit
other two files are used for generating test pattrens.

Folder: conventional atpg
this folder contains 4 files
a) approximate adder in the .bench format
b) approximate multiplier in the .bench format
c) test patterns generated by ATALANTA tool for both circuits

Folder: proposed Atpg tool
this folder contains the code for proposed tool.



Process to run files in folder :proposed Atpg tool



1)We carried out our work in linux ( ubuntu 18.04 LTS “Bionic Beaver” ) operating system.
2)run 'sudo apt install yosys' in terminal to install yosys
3)run 'sudo apt install picosat' in terminal to install picosat
4)In the current working directory i.e (proposed atpg tool) run 'chmod 777 atpgtool'
5)run 'sudo apt-get install -y tcl-dev' to install tcl pacakage
6)copy approx_mul.v or approx_addr.v file in working directory
7}To generate test pattrens for multiplier ckt run './atpgtool approx_mul.v 5 4'
8}To generate test pattrens for adder ckt run './atpgtool adder_mul.v 11 8'
