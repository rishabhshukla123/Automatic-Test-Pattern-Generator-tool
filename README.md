Approximate computing is widely used in the areas which require huge computation and the accuracy need not to be hundred percent. So approximate computing provides a trade off between regorous computing and accuracy. As a result various hardwares and accelerators are proposed using approximate computing. During the manufacturing of these circuits some faulty circuits could be produced. To test these circuits we require test pattern generation tools. In the market when these circuits are tested using conventional tools, these tools generates the test patterns for each and every fault in the circuit. So, unlike the conventional tools, a method is proposed which exploits the approximate nature of the circuit while testing. By employing this method yield of manufaturing the circuit can be incresed. It allows us to significantly reduce the number of faults to be tested, and test time also reduces accordingly, without sacrificing the output quality or test coverage.
